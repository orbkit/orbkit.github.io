In this chapter, the features and options for calculating grid-based quantities are provided.
Detailed tutorials for the three variants of executing ORBKIT, i.e., 
as a standalone program via the Terminal (:doc:`./terminal`),
with a Python script setting options and calling the main function of ORBKIT (:doc:`./highlevel`),
or with a user-written Python program using the built-in functions of ORBKIT (:doc:`./lowlevel`),
