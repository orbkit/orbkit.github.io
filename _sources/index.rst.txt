ORBKIT
======

ORBKIT is a parallel Python program package for post-processing 
wave function data from output files of quantum chemical programs.

The computational capabilities of ORBKIT range from grid-based quantities, e.g., molecular orbitals or 
electron density, to non grid-based quantities for instance Mulliken population charges or
analytical overlap integrals between molecular orbitals. 
There are several options and features to control the respective calculations like grid types and parameters. 
The required data can be extracted from MOLPRO_ (Molden File Format), 
TURBOMOLE_ (AOMix file format), GAMESS-US_, PROAIMS/AIMPAC (wfn/wfx file format), and Gaussian_ (.log File and Formatted Checkpoint File)
output files. Futhermore, an interface to cclib, a parser for quantum chemical logfiles, is provided.
A complete list of all input and output formats as well as quantities and features of ORBKIT is given in 
:doc:`./general`.

This documentation should serve as an overview of how to operate ORBKIT as a standalone program 
and how to use it in your own Python programs. The latter is facilitated by its modular design.
For a quick introduction to ORBKIT, see the :doc:`./quick` or stick to the example files in 
the ORBKIT program packet.
Tutorials for the calculation of grid-based and non grid-based quantities are given in section 
:doc:`./gridbased/index` and :doc:`./nongridbased/index`.
Supplementary, a detailed description of the existing options, main variables, and functions 
is given in :doc:`./refs/index`.
Finally, some additional applications of ORBKIT are presented in :doc:`./adtutorials/index`. 

**NEW:** :ref:`detCI\@ORBKIT` extends ORBKIT's functionality to multi-determinantal wave functions.
