We assume that you have followed the :ref:`installation-instructions` and that
you have navigated to the folder ``$ORBKITPATH/examples/basic_examples``. 
Please note that the input files are compressed in .tar.gz file in the examples 
folder (``$ORBKITPATH/examples/basic_examples/NaCl_molden_files.tar.gz``) and need to be 
decompressed before performing this tutorial.

.. hint::
  
  This tutorial explains parts of the example file 
  ``$ORBKITPATH/examples/basic_examples/use_for_ordering.py``. 

How to Read a List of Files
---------------------------

As a starting point, you have to import the ORBKIT module for processing 
multiple files::
  
  from orbkit import multiple_files
  
Now, we have to create a list of input file names::

  import os
  path = 'NaCl_molden_files'  
  # How are input files formatted?
  fid = 'nacl.%03d.molden'
  fid_list = []
  for i in range(0,16,1):
    f = os.path.join(path,fid % i)
    if not os.path.exists(f):
      raise IOError('%s does not exist!' % f)
    fid_list.append(f)

Here, we have used the ``os`` module to get sure that all input files exist.

The input files can be read with::

  multiple_files.read(fid_list,itype='molden',all_mo=True,nosym=False)

Now, all input variables are global values in the module ``multiple_files``.
These variables are named according to their analogue in the ``QCinfo`` class 
(cf. :ref:`Central Variables`):

+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Variable        | Contents                                                                                             |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``geo_spec_all`` | Contains all molecular **geometries**, see :ref:`geo_spec <qc.geo_spec>` in :ref:`Central Variables`.|
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``geo_info``     | See :ref:`geo_info <qc.geo_info>` in :ref:`Central Variables`.                                       |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``ao_spec``      | See :ref:`ao_spec <qc.ao_spec>` in :ref:`Central Variables`.                                         |

|``ao_spherical`` | See :ref:`ao_spherical <qc.ao_spherical>` in :ref:`Central Variables`.                               |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``mo_coeff_all`` | Contains all molecular orbital **coefficients**. List of ``numpy.ndarray``.                          |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``mo_energy_all``| Contains all molecular orbital **energies**. List of ``numpy.ndarray``.                              |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``mo_occ_all``   | Contains all molecular orbital **occupations**. List of ``numpy.ndarray``.                           |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``sym``          | Python dictionary containing the molecular orbital **symmetries** and the                            |
|                 | corresponding position in ``mo_coeff_all``, ``mo_energy_all``, and ``mo_occ_all``, respectively.     |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``index_list``   | After the execution of the ordering routine, it contains the new **indices** of the                  |
|                 | molecular orbitals. If index < 0, the molecular orbital changes its **sign**. ``shape=(Nfiles,NMO)``.|
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

How to Order the Molecular Orbital Coefficients
-----------------------------------------------

ORBKIT provides different schemes to order molecular orbitals, of which the
best shall be presented here: the ordering using analytical integrals between
neighboring molecular orbitals.

This procedure is a black box procedure and can be called with::

  index_list, mo_overlap = multiple_files.order_using_analytical_overlap(None)

The input argument ``None`` has been used since we have read already the 
input files.

This function changes all global variables and returns an index list containing
the new indices of the molecular orbitals. 

.. note::

  If the index is negative, the molecular orbital changes its sign. 

Moreover, it returns the molecular orbital
overlap matrix between the molecular orbitals of two neighboring
geometries, i.e., ``mo_overlap[i,j,k]`` corresponds to overlap between the 
:math:`j` th molecular orbital at geometry :math:`i` to the :math:`k` th molecular orbital at 
geometry :math:`(i+1)`. 

How to Save and Read the Information Obtained to and from an HDF5-File
----------------------------------------------------------------------

All global variables of the module ``multiple_files`` can be stored to an 
HDF5-file by::
  
  multiple_files.save_hdf5('nacl.h5')

To read this file and recover the global variables, simply call::

  multiple_files.read_hdf5('nacl.h5')

How to Depict Several Molecular Orbitals
----------------------------------------

You can use this module to depict snapshots of selected molecular orbitals 
with simple contour plots::

  selected_mos = ['24.1','23.2'] # Specifies, which MOs to be plotted
  r0 = 1                         # Specifies the starting structure geo_spec_all[r0]
  steps = 5                      # Specifies, how many steps to printed in one graph
  
  select_slice = 'xz'            # Selects which plane to be plotted
  where = 0.0                    # Selects where to place the plane (Here, y=0)

  multiple_files.show_selected_mos(selected_mos,r0=r0,steps=steps,
				   select_slice=select_slice,where=where)

How to Perform a Standard ORBKIT Computation for One Molecular Structures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can cast the global variables of ``multiple_files`` automatically to a list 
of ``QCinfo`` classes (cf. :ref:`Central Variables`) by::
  
  QC = multiple_files.construct_qc()

Now, you can access every data point separately and perform ORBKIT calculations,
e.g.::

  import orbkit as ok

  r = 0                    # Index to be calculated
  out_fid = 'nacl_r%d' % r # Specifies the name of the output file

  # Initialize orbkit with default parameters and options
  ok.init()

  # Set some options
  ok.options.adjust_grid= [5, 0.5]                # adjust the grid to the geometry
  ok.options.otype      = 'mayavi'                  # output file (base) name

  # Run orbkit with one instance of qc as input
  ok.run_orbkit(QC[10])

How to Process Data of Two or More dimensions 
---------------------------------------------

Since the ordering routine is only suitable for one dimensional data, the input
data has to be rearranged if you want to treat problems of higher dimensionality.

We suggest two different approaches, which may be applied to an arbitrary number
of dimensions:

   :scale: 80 %

   :align: center

.. attention::
  
  Please make always sure that the ordering procedure was successful by plotting
  and checking the final molecular orbital overlaps and molecular orbital 
  coefficients!
