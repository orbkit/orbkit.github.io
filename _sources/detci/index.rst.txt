detCI\@ORBKIT
=============

detCI\@ORBKIT is an extension of ORBKIT for post-processing **multi-determinant**
wave function data from the data of quantum chemical calculations.
Our general procedure, allows to apply one-electron operators to the multi-electron 
explicitly time-dependent molecular wave function.
The main scope of this procedure is to analyze and visualize correlated electron dynamics
by interpreting several fundamental one-electron quantities, such as the :ref:`Electron Density`,
the transient :ref:`Electronic Flux Density`, and the :ref:`Electronic Dipole Moment`.

For the theoretical background, details on the implementation, and the robustness of these quantities, see 

  Vincent Pohl, Gunter Hermann, and Jean Christophe Tremblay,
  "An Open-Source Framework of Analyzing *N*-electron Dynamics: I. Multi-Determinantal Wave Functions", 
  `arXiv:XXX.XXXXX`__ (2017).
